Discord Bot for the Shadowlands Pre-Patch Icecrown Rare Bosses  

This is some pretty ugling coding. Was thrown together fast for the 2 week prepatch event in World of Warcraft on 10NOV2020.  
I don't know javascript well enough to do all the code in there that I needed.
Also should have used functions instead of copy/pasting code in the powershell.. then again, it's for a 2 week temp event so speed over code style in this case.  

So the javascript is the frontend Discord Bot and powershell was used for the backend time calculations.
